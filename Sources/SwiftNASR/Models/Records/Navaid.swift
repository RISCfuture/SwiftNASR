 A radio navigational aid such as a VOR or an NDB.
 
 Navaids are uniquely identified by their name and facility type; for example,
 the Astoria VOR/DME is distinct from the Astoria fan marker though they both
 have the identifier "AST".
 
 Fields in this model that reference other record types (e.g.,
 ``lowAltitudeARTCC``, which references ``ARTCC``) will be `nil` unless the
 associated type has been parsed with ``NASR/parse(_:withProgress:errorHandler:completionHandler:)`` or one of its
