/**
 Flight service stations are FAA facilities that provide in-flight information
 to pilots but do not provide separation services (except in limited local cases
 when the FSS is associated with an uncontrolled airport).
 
 Fields in this model that reference other record types (e.g.,
 ``airport``, which references ``Airport``) will be `nil` unless the
 associated type has been parsed with ``NASR/parse(_:withProgress:errorHandler:completionHandler:)`` or one of its
 variants.
