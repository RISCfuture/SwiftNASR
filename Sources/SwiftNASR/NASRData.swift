/**
 A Codable class containing all data parsed from a NASR distribution. The
 members of this class will be `nil` until their respective calls to
 `NASR.parse` have been made.
 
 This class can be encoded to disk using an `Encoder` of your choice, retrieved
 later using the corresponding `Decoder`, and re-associated with a `SwiftNASR`
 object using `NASR.fromData`. Parsing the data takes much longer than decoding
 it, so it is recommended to parse the data only once per cycle, and retrieve it
 using a `Decoder` thereafter.
 
 NASRData is also responsible for providing cross-references between classes.
 For example, the `associatedAirport` property on `FSS` references an `Airport`
 which is part of the same containing `NASRData` instance. Rather than directly
 set a reference between the FSS and the airport (which can create circular
 dependencies), `FSS.associatedAirp√üort` is a computed property that uses the
 containing `NASRData` instance to find the associated airport.
